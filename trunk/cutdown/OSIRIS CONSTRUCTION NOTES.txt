OSIRIS CONSTRUCTION NOTES
-------------------------

Construction Steps:
- Populate power connector, use keyed pin-header with tab on edge of PCB.
- Populate C1, C2, C10, C11
- Populate LDO Regulator if using >3.3v supply
- Populate TPS61200 chip if using <3.3v supply.

- Test regulator. Check for 3.3v where 3.3v should be.

- Populate all decoupling capacitors.
- Populate ATMega328P, Crystal, crystal capacitors, reset pullup (R1).
- Populate ISP header and test if ISP can talk to chip.
	- May need to use a lower ISP speed at first.
	
- Populate R6, R7, LEDs. Use Red LED for spot closest to ISP header.
- Program Arduino bootloader to chip, test by blinking LEDs.

- Populate RFM22B Module, SS Pullup (R15)
- Test RFM22B with example code from RF22 library.
	- rf22_client example will make board transmit on 434MHz.
	
- Populate temp sensors, dual-FET, etc as required.

- Profit!
